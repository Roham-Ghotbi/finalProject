clean up html and do some VERY basic styling
figure out if doing everything in one page with shifting focus is possible
improve routing
clean up models
figure out how to do everything via popup menus
enable order by date of actions
enable dragging of actions
error checking of user actions everywhere via popup menus
check clickable regions and add buttons
do security(passswords fixed) and google sign up(for this wI thinkg we need to at least have our website url set)
styling forever

what happens when someone goes straight to /timeline without logging in? we need to handle gracefully and elegantly everywhere



POPOVERS

		keep popover open on hover over popover
	hover to display more content
	click to open action focus

FORM SUBMISSIONS WITH POPUPS/TOOLTIPS
